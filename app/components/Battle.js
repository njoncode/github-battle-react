/**
 * The Component Lifecycle

Every time our React app runs, all of our components go through a specific lifecycle. We can break down that lifecycle into three parts.

    1. When the component gets added to the DOM (mounting).
    2. When the component updates its state or receives new data via props (updating).
    3. When the component gets removed from the DOM (unmounting).

 * constructor(props) {
    // Good for establishing the initial state of a component
    super(props)
    this.state = {}
  }
  componentDidMount(){
    // Invoked once the component is mounted to the DOM.
    // Good for making AJAX requests.
  }
  componentDidUpdate(){
    // Invoked immediately after updating occurs.
    // Good for AJAX requests based on changing props or DOM operations.
  }
  componentWillUnmount(){
    // Called right before a component is unmounted.
    // Good for cleaning up listeners.
  }
 *
